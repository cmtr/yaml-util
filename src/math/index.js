/**
 * Math Libary for configuring Math Operations within JSON or YAML files. This in
 * order to have dynamically defined variables.
 * 
 * NOTE:
 * For Math to be calculated correctly the order of execution needst to follow 
 * the order of operations, which is used throughout mathematics, science, 
 * technology and many computer programming languages, is expressed here:
 * 
 * 1. exponentiation and root extraction
 * 2. multiplication and division
 * 3. addition and subtraction
